                    <h3>The Marriott Theater in Lincolnshire</h3>
                    <p>
                        The Marriot Theatre needed a solution which allowed them to connect various different collections of information in a way that was coherent and usable for site users. I was responsible for architecting and implementing the solution from start to finish, using <a href='http://businesscatalyst.com/' target='_blank'>Adobe Business Catalyst's</a> custom web app framework.<br>
                        Working around the various quirks and limitations of the platform, I was able to build a system which brought the necessary data to the page in a structured manner which enabled the appropriate views to be built on the client side. The site is currently live at <a href='http://www.marriotttheatre.com/' target='_blank' rel="noopener noreferrer">www.marriotttheatre.com</a>.

One area I've made some intriguing contributions to has been on the "Featured Post" template, which is used by our editorial staff to distinguish certain articles

One area I've been able to made some interesting contributions to has been on the "Featured Post" template,
(primarily long-form or investigative content) from the regular posts that appear on the sites.
