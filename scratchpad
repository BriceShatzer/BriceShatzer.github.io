                    <p>
                        The Marriot Theatre needed a solution which allowed them to connect various different collections of information in a way that was coherent and usable for site users. I was responsible for architecting and implementing the solution from start to finish, using <a href='http://businesscatalyst.com/' target='_blank'>Adobe Business Catalyst's</a> custom web app framework.<br>
                        Working around the various quirks and limitations of the platform, I was able to build a system which brought the necessary data to the page in a structured manner which enabled the appropriate views to be built on the client side. The site is currently live at <a href='http://www.marriotttheatre.com/' target='_blank' rel="noopener noreferrer">www.marriotttheatre.com</a>.
