Summary

I am a Chicago-based technologist with a decade of experience in web development, having successfully delivered software at Grainger, PayPal, and G/O Media (The Onion/Gizmodo/Lifehacker/Kotaku/etc.) that is experienced by hundreds of millions of users worldwide.

While I have historically specialized in crafting novel user-facing interactions and possess a deep understanding of implementing design for the web in an architecturally sound manner, I am comfortable working across the stack and have developed a passion for the administrative & organizational processes of software development.

Outside of work, I'm a soccer fan & avid Chicago Fire supporter and have 2 adorable little dogs named Colby & Marge.
