                <h2>Hi! I'm Brice...</h2>
                <p>
                    I've spent the past 7 years in the world of web development, working with clients of varying sizes on dozens of different platforms & technologies across the stack. I'm comfortable with pretty much anything written in code, but primarily specialize in crafting bespoke and intriguing client-facing interactions. Having been academically trained in graphic design and digital media production, I have the rare combination of being design-aware as well as understanding, in depth, how to implement design for the web in an architecturally sound manner.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Currently, I'm working as a developer at <a href="http://www.doejo.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Doejo</a>, a digital agency based in Chicago, but I'm always open to chatting with new and interesting people about what they're up to :)

As the lone developer on the project, I successfully executed on the designer's ambitious vision, weaving a variety of innovative and technically novel pieces into a single, seamless, platform-agnoistic experience. A full writeup on the project can be found on the <a href="http://doejo.com/blog/zorch%E2%80%8A-%E2%80%8A3d-animation-and-web-design/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Doejo blog</a>.

IBD and <a href="http://doejo.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Doejo</a> collaborated to create a streamlined workflow of content creation within an updated CMS and implemented lightning-fast, seamless integration of online publishing to print production. The front end received a facelift, including flexible page designs, allowing user-friendly layout updates on the fly.

                        I joined the project a few months into the development process, with the specific purpose of auditing and refactoring the front-end code that had already been written. In addition to resolving the outstanding issues uncovered, I handled the majority of the remaining front-end development work, and helped define and implement a modern development and QA work flow for the organization going forward.

After a few months, I decided to do something about that. In my spare time, I took it upon myself to create the information repository that I had wished existed when I first started.
