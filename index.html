                <h2>Hi! I'm Brice...</h2>
                <p>
                    I've spent the past decade in the world of web development, working with companies of varying sizes on dozens of different platforms & technologies. I'm comfortable working across the stack, but primarily specialize in crafting novel and intriguing user-facing interactions and have developed the ability of being design-aware while possessing a deep understanding of how to implement design for the web in an architecturally sound manner.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Beyond the technical and creative aspects of my work, I've developed a passion for the administrative and organizational processes around the craft of software development (<em class="group-text">I ‚ù§Ô∏è documentation</em> üòç) and would love for my next role to enable me to explore that passion. 
                </p>

                <p class="always-open-to-chatting">
                    I recently wrapped up my role on the Core Experience team at <a href="https://www.grainger.com/" rel="noreferrer">Grainger</a>, and I'm open to connecting with new and interesting people. If you're working on something exciting, feel free to reach out ‚Äî I'd love to chat!

                    <h3>Pay With Venmo</h3>
                    <p>
                        As the parent company of Venmo, PayPal wanted the ability for Venmo users to complete checkout transactions using their <a href="https://developer.paypal.com/docs/checkout/pay-with-venmo/" rel="noreferrer">Venmo account as a funding source</a>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For this to occur, the user must be able to authorize the transaction in their Venmo app. We do this by generating an app-specific url which will launch the Venmo app on the user's device in a way that allows it to interact with a Firebase backend which manages the state & relationship between the particular PayPal Checkout SDK being used and the app, regarding the transaction that is currently in the process of being authorized. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In the event that the checkout process is occurring in an environment where the Venmo app isn't available (such as on desktop), we generate a QR Code which is readable by the Venmo app and launches the authorization flow for that transaction. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Finally, all of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210515082946/https://github.com/paypal/paypal-smart-payment-buttons/pull/158/files" rel="noreferrer">this built out functionality</a> needed to be <a href="https://github.com/paypal/paypal-checkout-components/pull/1632/files" rel="noreferrer">integrated</a> into the broader <a href="https://github.com/paypal/paypal-checkout-components" rel="noreferrer">PayPal Checkout Web SDK</a>, enabling it to be run in a cross-domain manner. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I served as the primary developer and point of contact for the Checkout Integrations team, building out the web implementation portions of the solution.

                            "All of the sites look the same", had been a consistent refrain that the product team has heard from both the editorial staff and readers throughout the life of Kinja, and only intensified when the brands of Onion, Inc. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200926012420/https://product.kinja.com/the-onion-is-now-publishing-on-kinja-1819619421" rel="noreferrer">migrated on to the platform</a>.

                        The branded merchandising company Zorch, came to <a href="http://doejo.com" rel="noreferrer">Doejo</a> looking to update their web presence to better reflect the modern, technology-driven approach they use to help their customers on a daily basis. As the lone developer on the project, I successfully executed on the designer's ambitious vision, weaving a variety of innovative and technically novel pieces into a single, seamless, platform-agnoistic experience. A full writeup on the project can be found on the <a href="http://doejo.com/blog/zorch%E2%80%8A-%E2%80%8A3d-animation-and-web-design/" rel="noreferrer">Doejo blog</a>.

                        <a href="http://investors.com" rel="noreferrer">Investor‚Äôs Business Daily (IBD)</a> is a leader in the financial, economic, and political news sector. IBD and <a href="http://doejo.com" rel="noreferrer">Doejo</a> collaborated to create a streamlined workflow of content creation within an updated CMS and implemented lightning-fast, seamless integration of online publishing to print production. The front end received a facelift, including flexible page designs, allowing user-friendly layout updates on the fly.

                    <p>
                        I joined the project a few months into the development process, with the specific purpose of auditing and refactoring the front-end code that had already been written. In addition to resolving the outstanding issues uncovered, I handled the majority of the remaining front-end development work, and helped define and implement a modern development and QA work flow for the organization going forward.

                        When I first arrived at <a href="http://doejo.com/" rel="noreferrer">Doejo</a>, I was frustrated by the lack of information that was available to new hires. After a few months, I decided to do something about that. In my spare time, I took it upon myself to create the information repository that I had wished existed when I first started.

                        The project was an implementation of <a href="https://github.com/gollum/gollum" rel="noreferrer">Gollum</a> (a Git-powered wiki system built in Ruby), that I extended to add custom functionality like:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>OAuth authentication</li>
                        <li>the ability to embed Google Docs </li>
                        <li>specialty content components </li>
                        <li>various menu & navigation improvements</li>
                        <li>containerization via Docker with the help of our dev-ops specialist</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        Additionally, I also became the project's primary content contributor, writing on a wide variety of topics including: company policies & procedures, how-tos for internal tools, coding style guides/best practices, and client/project notes.

                        I worked with <a href='http://packback.co/' rel="noreferrer">Packback Books</a> to help build and launch version 2 of their digital text book rental platform. The site uses AngularJS on top of a Laravel back-end. Additionally, I was tasked with creating a common styling framework and pattern library which is still used across all of their various properties.
