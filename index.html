                <h2>Hi! I'm Brice...</h2>
                <p>
                    I've spent the past several years in the world of web development, working with clients of varying sizes on dozens of different platforms & technologies across the stack. I'm comfortable with pretty much anything written in code, but primarily specialize in crafting bespoke and intriguing client-facing interactions. Having been academically trained in graphic design and digital media production, I have the rare combination of being design-aware as well as understanding, in depth, how to implement design for the web in an architecturally sound manner.

                    Currently, I'm working on a bunch of <a href="https://g-omedia.com/" rel="noreferrer">websites you've probably heard of</a>, but I'm always open to chatting with new and interesting people about what they're up to, so please don't hesitate to get in touch :)

                    <h3>Doejo Docs</h3>
                    <p>
                        When I first arrived at <a href="http://doejo.com/" rel="noreferrer">Doejo</a>, I was frustrated by the lack of information that was available to new hires. After a few months, I decided to do something about that. In my spare time, I took it upon myself to create the information repository that I had wished existed when I first started.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The project was an implementation of <a href="https://github.com/gollum/gollum" rel="noreferrer">Gollum</a> (a Git-powered wiki system built in Ruby), that I extended to add custom functionality like:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>OAuth authentication</li>
                        <li>the ability to embed Google Docs </li>
                        <li>specialty content components </li>
                        <li>various menu & navigation improvements</li>
                        <li>containerization via Docker with the help of our dev-ops specialist</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        Additionally, I also became the project's primary content contributor, writing on a wide variety of topics including: company policies & procedures, how-tos for internal tools, coding style guides/best practices, and client/project notes.

                    <p>
                        I worked with <a href='http://packback.co/' rel="noreferrer">Packback Books</a> to help build and launch version 2 of their digital text book rental platform. The site uses AngularJS on top of a Laravel back-end. Additionally, I was tasked with creating a common styling framework and pattern library which is still used across all of their various properties. It can be found <a href='https://github.com/packbackbooks/frontend-common' rel="noreferrer">here</a>.

                        An article written for the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170628180906/http://doejo.com/blog/sniff-out-code-smells-using-media-queries/" rel="noreferrer">Doejo blog</a> that discusses some strategies around using JavaScript to painlessly audit an unfamiliar front-end code base, with the goal of uncovering idiosyncrasies and flaws that could potentially cause issues maintaining or enhancing the project going forward.
